### What are FATE/FUDGE dice?
FATE dice are normal six sided dies with a `+` on two sides, a `-` on two sides, and two blank sides. The dice are typically thrown in groups of four, and the result of the roll is the sum of the individual rolls.

For example if you roll four FATE dice and two land showing `+`, another lands showing `-`, and the fourth die face is blank, the sum would be +1. In RPGs that use FATE dice, results greater than 0 traditionally indicate a successful roll, and results less than 0 indicate failure.
